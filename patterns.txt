Design patterns
________________

What are design patterns?
    - Solutions / guidelines to recurring problems
    - A description or template for how to solve a problem.


Types of design patterns (Based on the Gang of Four book)

Creational
___________

What do creational design patterns do?
    - They are focused towards how to instantiate an object or group of related
      objects.

Simple factory pattern:

How it works: 
    - It simply generates an instance for the client without exposing any
      instantiation logic.

When should this pattern be used?
    - When creating an object involves some logic as opposed to basic
      assignment.


Factory method:

How it works:
    - It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.


When should this pattern be used?
    - When using generic class processing but the required subclass is
      dynamically decided at run time.

    - in basic terms: when the client doesnt know what sub-class it might need.



Abstract factory:
    
How it works:
    - Its a factory of factories.
    - It groups the individual but related/dependant factories togethor without
      specifying their conrcete classes.

When should this pattern be used?
    - When there are interrelated dependencies with not-so-simple creation
      logic involved.



Builder:

How it works:
    - It allows different flavors of objects to be created while avoiding
      constructor pollution.
    
    - Useful when theres several types of an object being created

    - also useful for when the creation of an ojbect involves a lot of steps.


When should this pattern be used?
    - when several flavors of an object are being created and to avoid
      constructor pollution

    - unlike the factory pattern, where the creation is a single step process,
        the builder pattern is used for a multi-step creation process.
