# Adapter Pattern ðŸ”Œ

## Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter, making it compatible with another class.

### Example 

- In this example, imagine a video game where there is a hunter who hunts lions.
- Now lets say we want to extend the game to add wild dogs to the list of items a hunter can hunt
- Currently the hunter can only interact with objects implementing the Lion interface
- An adapter would have to be created so the hunter can interact with wild dogs as he would with lions.
- The code in this directory does just that
